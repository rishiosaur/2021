INTRO

Hi there. How are you? That's great. It's a fast moving world out there, stranger.

Have you ever wondered what it'd be like to slow down?

To take a breather? Me, too.  In tech, it's too easy to get bogged down with speed.

Constant iteration, Lighthouse results, Jira stats: why?

What happened to storytelling?

What happened to the ideas behind the façade?

This website isn't a duct-taped resumé. It's a world to discover.

Like the world we live in, there is often more than meets the eye.

Welcome to my strange home.
